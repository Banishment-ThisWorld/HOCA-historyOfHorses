          <h3>Preface</h3>
          <p>The horse has a high status in Chinese culture and has a series of symbolic meanings. The horse is included in Chinese zodiacs, being a symbol of ability, sage, talent, and action. The ancients often used the analogy of the "Thousand-Li Horse'' (千里马), which is an excellent steed that travels a thousand miles a day, to represent talents. Nowadays, the spirit of the horse still contains loyalty, nobility, unstoppable self-improvement, and unconquerability.<br>These characteristics can be revealed by representing artifacts about horses in the history of Chinese art. However, as what we learned at the beginning of the class, dated back to the Shang dynasty, horses were sacrificed in tombs of kings, representing nothing but available animal resources for military and transportation use. No tribes nor dynasty deified horses as ritual figures.<br>So how did horses transform from a functional animal to some spiritual or political representatives throughout Chinese history?<br>The exhibition includes the functions and usages of horses in history, various artifacts related to horses, and how economics, politics, and philosophy shapes artists’ and people’s understanding of horses. By chronologically presenting significant artifacts and comparing them, the audience will be able to understand how the spiritual characteristics of animals have been endowed and developed in Chinese art.

          <h3>Transition One</h3>
          <p>The territory expansion, domestication of horses, importing from the minorities, as well as the instincts of horses become the foundation of ideology expansion on the horses. Horses were a scarce resource for wars at the beginning. However, as the economics developed, horses gradually became a representative of social status, became the symbol of “talent” within the literati due to the story of Bole, and even became labor forces for commoners.

                  <div class="War">
                    <h3>War</h3>
                    <p>Horses are essential in warfare for cavalry soldiers as well as chariots.<br>This artifact refers to a set of two bronze model chariots at the Mauseleum of the First Qin Emperor (reigned 247-220 BCE). The first chariot as a whole is 225 centimeters long and 152 centimeters high. It has a small oblong carriage that is 0.45 meters long and 0.74 meters wide. A canopy protrudes from the chariot's carriage and acts as an umbrella providing shade for the charioteer, covering an area of about 1.17 square meters. The canopy consists of two parts: one is the pedestal and the other is a handle. The canopy is removable and thus can be put in and taken away. Compared to the first Chariot, Chariot Two is bigger with a length measuring 3.17 meters. The charioteer is kneeling on the front chamber with a humble facial expression.The carriage is designed to serve its host. It has windows on three sides and a door on the back. The horses had different heads and hairstyles and also differed in the heights of the heads. The decoration on the head of the bronze horses was very delicate with an inverted triangular metal sheet on the top of the head of each horse, on which the fine patterns were carved. In addition, the weight of gold and silver ornaments exceeded 14 kg. They were made up of more than 3500 parts by various technologies such as casting, inlaying, welding, buckle connecting, living hinge connecting, and different kinds of technical skills such as mechanical connection and processing. The copper wire used for the necklace of precious stones and chains on the horse was only about half a millimeter in diameter, and some were even thinner, representing the brilliant achievements of China’s metal manufacturing process more than 2,000 years ago.

                  <div class="Transportation">
                    <h3>Transportation</h3>
                    <p>Horses have long been used as a means of transportation in China.<br>The artifact was painted by Zhang Xuan, a court painter of renown during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). There are eight horses and nine characters in the painting. The inscriptions by later generations point out that this painting is about a spring outing. Some of these inscriptions associated this painting with the poem Trip of Beauties by the famous Tang poet Du Fu (712-770), who described with satire an extravagant outing of the sisters of Yang Guifei, the much-beloved Imperial Consort of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (685-762). So there is a long-established opinion, at least since the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, holding that this work depicts a spring strip by Lady Guoguo, the third sister of Yang Guifei. Emperor Zhangzong of the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234), who deemed this painting as a replica by Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, inscribed on this work the three Chinese characters “Tian shuimo” which belongs to Emperor Huizong. But modern scholars tend to opine that this painting was actually created by a court painter. It is just that the emperor took credit for it by putting his own seal on it. Even if Emperor Huizong didn’t paint the work by himself, it is undoubted that he attached great importance to it.

                    <h3>Gift</h3>
                    <p>Horses are widely used as gifts and tributes throughout Chinese history.<br>This artifact was painted by Han Gan in the Tang Dynasty. The handscroll is a copy from the Ming Dynasty. In the middle, two Tang officials hold the reins of exotic horses, accompanied with several envoys. While the particular ethnicity of these grooms is difficult to identify, the skillfully rendered details of their luxurious costumes and the blankets on the horses suggest they are Central Asian emissaries traveling to the Tang dynasty capital Chang'an to bring precious tributes to the Chinese emperor. Such exotic scenes were undoubtedly quite common in that great cosmopolitan city during the seventh and eighth centuries, and similar processions of tribute bearers and horses appear in several paintings, all of which were based on original compositions from the Tang dynasty. The spurious inscription on the painting and the large seal above the central horse point to the famous eighth-century horse painter Han Gan as the artist. The vivacity of the painting is expressed in horses’ strong muscles, various standing postures, and colorful decorations.

                    <h3>Leisure activities</h3>
                    <p>Horses have played an important role in the leisure activities of the noble, such as polo ponies for sport and trained dancing horses for entertainment. Also, for upper classes, riding horses for spring outing or hunting was quite popular.<br>This artifact reproduces the scene of the birthday celebration of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty. It features a decorative design of a horse with a ribbon around its neck and its tail flowing in the air. During the Qianqiu Festival, Emperor Xuanzong’s birthday, there were hundreds of horses dancing to the rhythm of music. At climax, these horses would leap on three-story beds and start to spin. The leading horse would hold a drinking cup in its mouth to toast the emperor, as shown in the artifact. The impressive scene was unique to the palace because the horses were specially selected from imported horses and trained with dancing skills, which only the emperor could afford. After the outbreak of the An Lushan rebellion, these horses were treated as monsters outside the palace when they started to dance with music. The dancing horse witnesses the Tang Dynasty turning from its peak to the decline. In addition to its rich culture, the artifact also demonstrates sophisticated craft skills. Imitating Khitan pots, this pot is made of silver inlaid with gold, where you can hardly find any sign of welding.

          <h3>Transition Two - Early Period</h3>
          <p>In the Qin and Han dynasties, horses were often seen in murals, sculptures and stone carvings. The horse figurines in Qin Shi Huang tombs have a high degree of realistic skills. The form of the pottery horse is accurate, vivid, strong and vigorous. The "Horse riding Huns" (马踏匈奴) in front of the tomb of Huo Qubing of the Han Dynasty is a typical work of romanticism to express the valiency and nationalism of Han people against Huns. During this period, artists had basically mastered the structure of horses, and had skillfully expressed the various postures of horses. However, the underlying symbols represented by the horse were still closely related to its function during the war periods.<br>From the Wei, Jin, to the Sui Dynasty, there was a great development in horse painting, and horse paintings with independent ornamental value began to appear. Gu Kaizhi's "Luo Shen Fu" (洛神赋) in the Eastern Jin Dynasty depicts horses in different poses which poses are quite various: running, walking, stopping, and lying down, with precise and vivid shapes. The conscious pursuit of the "spirit" of the horse, rather than limiting it to the "form" of the horse, emerged in paintings during this period. The skills of horse painting had become more mature and independent horse painting had taken shape.

Two horses are beside a servant, one apparently grazing, the other looking up. Behind, a third horse is rolling on its back on the meadow, with a second servant watching.<br>This is the earliest work containing horses on the paintings. The spiritual meanings lack but the Chinese traditional techniques of presenting horses are clearly shown in the depiction.<br>Notably the horses are not involved in tasks of labor. Each horse seems to be relaxed and engaging in leisure, hinting at the evolution of the position of the horse from that of being a beast of burden or war, into something more akin to a pet or status symbol. This ternd would continue into later horse paintings as horses.

          <h3>Transition Three - Tang to Song</h3>
          <p>Horse paintings reached their peaks during the Tang Dynasty as during this period, the techniques of horse paintings were further developed while underlying symbolic meanings of horses were fully constructed and expressed in court paintings, in paintings of the Literary Class, and paintings by the ordinary people. As landscape painting was fully developed and prevalent during the Song Dynasty, the Horse painting stagnated and in a style that was relaxed but not sparse, transcendent but not wild. The aesthetic taste coincided with the social mentality of the people at the time, which was rational and easy-going.

This painting, the most famous work attributed to the artist, is a portrait of a charger of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712–56). With its burning eye, flaring nostrils, and dancing hoofs, the fiery-tempered horse epitomizes Chinese myths about Central Asian "celestial steeds" that "sweated blood" and were actually dragons in disguise, showing a supreme of richness in imperial horses. The seals and inscriptions added to the painting and its borders by later owners and appreciators are a distinctive feature of Chinese collecting and connoisseurship.

Ceramics.<br>Horses played an important role in Tang military expansion and in the life of the court; riding was a popular recreation, and even the court ladies played polo. One of a pair in the Denver Art Museum's collection, this ceramic figure is among the finest examples of polo players on galloping horses from the Tang dynasty. Polo is believed to have originated in ancient Iran, Central Asia, or Tibet, and it reached China by the late 600s via the Silk Road. Both men and women played the game, which was a favorite sport of the Tang court. A large number of ceramic polo player sculptures have been found in elite tombs of the Tang dynasty.<br>This figurine, and other depictions of horses playing polo symbolize the status of horses as both status symbols and creatures used for recreation. At this point in Chinese history horses both played an important role in the expansion of the empire, but also possessed an increasing spiritual and recreational role in the lives of Chinese elite.

          <h3>Transition Four - Yuan</h3>
          <p>The Yuan Dynasty was a huge empire supported by military power and cavalry was the core of the power of this country. The Mongol Yuan imperial family won the world on horseback, therefore, horses were seen as a sign of national power and the Mongols had an innate love for horses. In the history of Chinese painting, the Mongol Yuan period was a time of great prosperity for the development of saddle horse painting, and there were many masterpieces of horse painting and horse drawing, not only with a large number of works but also with many different titles.<br>Because of its own special conditions, horse painting became a good choice of painting subjects in the Yuan Dynasty. The nomadic and powerful nobles were very interested in horse painting, so many painters were promoted or entered the government with the help of horse painting, such as Zhao Mengfu and Ren Renfa, because of their talent, especially their ability to paint horses, and they rose through the ranks.<br>However, for the royal family, horses are more like a subject to the war as well as the representative of the status while for the literati, horses are used to express their feeling of not having met with the one appreciating their talents.

Zhao Mengfu had served the Yuan court as a government official, and this art piece was done shortly after his retirement. The picture shows a dignified groom standing beside a strong horse while holding the rein in his hands. The horse represents strength and groom motif is a reference to Bole, a figure who has the ability to identify talents within people. The groom’s appearance closely resembles the model image of a proper Chinese scholar official. The groom might be the artist’s self-portrait, suggesting that he holds some restraints over the authority while being someone who identifies and properly uses the talents of others.

          <h3>Transition Five -  Ming & Qing</h3>
          <p>In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the painting of horses appeared to be in decline. Though there  were still many paintings of horses surviving in the Ming and Qing dynasties’ court art, the painted horses were lacking in the pursuit of mood, more often used to reflect the wealth and ownership of the royal family. Literati painters used "horses" to express their feelings, such as Jin Nong of the Qing Dynasty, who inscribed on his painting "The Thin Horse": "Now I paint horses, pale and dreary." The horses in the paintings of this period were often old, sick and disabled or bleak horses, which implied a sense of worry. In the image of "horse", the artist's own shadow is reflected.

              <p class="box-text4">A Hundred Horses in a Landscape, Giuseppe Castiglione, Qing dynasty, Ink and color on paper, 1102 x 813cm<br>As a court painting, this work shows the abundance of wealth and military strength owned by Emperor Qianlong. The background shows a grand landscape, representing large territories owned by Qianlong, too. Giuseppe Castiglione has blended his European painting style in the horses with traditional Chinese landscape painting.

As in a literati painting, his horses are a reflection of his criticism and disappointment at the performance of his colleagues. The black and white horses represent lie and truth. Its European style shading shows the influence of European painting techniques on Chinese art.

                    <p>The artistic image of the horse embodies the culture and aesthetic mentality of the Chinese people, and it has a wide coverage and long-lasting continuity. When people appreciate the painting of horses, they can experience the connotation of it, which can cause emotional fluctuations, such as pride, anger, joy, or desolation, and make people's aesthetic needs satisfied. First of all, the feudal rulers love horses. In ancient China, many of the founding emperors were called the "Emperor on the horse", such as Li Shimin, Zhao Kuangchu, Zhu Yuanzhang, etc. The years of fires and wars led to the increasing status of horses in social life, especially in war, and the image of horses became an important subject in art.<br>Though the start of horse art is from the fires and wars, it never stops at the simple meaning of that. Bole (伯樂 bó lè) was a legendary judge of horses, said to be the inventor of equine physiognomy (相馬 xiàng mǎ, evaluating a horse’s qualities from appearance). He was so exceptional that even today in modern Chinese his name is used as a byword for judging hidden talent:
                    <br>伯樂相馬 (乐马) bó lè xiàng mǎ<br>Literally: Bole judges a horse<br>Figuratively: To be an outstanding judge of someone’s (hidden) gifts or talent.<br></p>
                    <a href="http://www.jasonpym.com/blog/2019/06/30/bole-judges-a-horse/" class="box-trigger"><p>http://www.jasonpym.com/blog/2019/06/30/bole-judges-a-horse/</p></a>
                    <p>When the Chinese imported military horses and chariots from foreign "horse riders", they concurrently introduced a complex equestrian culture, which resulted in new professions in fields such as horse domestication, selective horse breeding (as early as the 14th century BCE), horse training, horse riding, horse tack, horse care, veterinary medicine, and horse shamanism. After increasing horses being domesticated and imported, the horses can also be used for commoners as labor forces and transportation animals.<br>The elite class prefer the rich body of the horse, the literati love the leisure and elegant feeling about the horses, the ordinary people appreciate horses as they help in work and remember the way back home. It became a metaphor to express personal ambitions and philosophies, just as what landscape, flowers, and birds did as well. The Chinese traditional philosophy of expanding the characteristics of the subject, and further relate to personal interest and expression plays an important role in the evolution of symbolizing the horse paintings.

                    <p>Horses become symbols for all the classes.<br>The "rich" atmosphere of the royal family unified and influenced the aesthetic taste of the society, while the "elegant" atmosphere of the literati and scholars raised the creation and appreciation of horse painting to a deeper aesthetic level, forming a generation of style that forced the court painters to absorb its essence; while the exaggerated and decorative nature of the folk horse painting provided a wider scope for the expression of the horse's charm. We see that throughout the history of horse painting, these three ideologies have interacted and further supported the development of horse painting, influencing Chinese understanding of horses.<br>Essentially, the changes of symbolic meaning came from the development of economies and the vast domestication of horses, which allows court arts, literati arts, as well as commoner arts to include horses in the painting and reflect the authors or their ideologies on the horses. Though what horses symbolize are closely related to their instincts, the underlying meaning of these paintings further expanded as they involved painters’ stories. These stories were gradually binded with the subject of the paintings--horses--and develop throughout the history of Chinese art.
